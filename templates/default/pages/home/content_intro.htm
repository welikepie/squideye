<h1>Welcome to the LemonStand Demo Store</h1>
<p>This is a demonstration store powered by the <a href="http://lemonstandapp.com">LemonStand shopping cart</a>. It's a basic store with standard functionality on an eCommerce site. You may log into the <a href="/backdoor/session/handle/create#auto_login">admin area</a> and edit content, templates and products if you wish, or generate some reports. The Administrative user interface has been removed to avoid tampering with the system, so some features are not accessible in the demo. <a href="http://lemonstandapp.com/demo/">Read here</a> for more details.</p>
