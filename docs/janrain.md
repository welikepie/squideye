JANRAIN INTEGRATION
===================

Janrain provides greatly improved login facilities, allowing, among other things, Social Login (registering and logging in with various social sites instead of dedicated set of credentials) through simple API and Single Sign-On across multiple sites. The platform is to be integrated with both the shop and the design submission services.

[ as for the features, the part will be completed once an access is gained for their service ]

Game Plan
---------

* Integrate Social Login with LemonStand's registration functionality
* Do the same for standard Login procedure
* Ensure the automatic login in case of any social networks being available
* Integrate Single Sign-On with both shop and tattoo submission service
* Social registration will require submission of an email address
